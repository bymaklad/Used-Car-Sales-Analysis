# Used Car Sales – Power BI Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project provides a full analytical study of a used car sales dataset using Power BI.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, normalization, modelling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development.
The final dashboard delivers insights into manufacturers, car models, engine sizes, fuel types, and year-based availability trends.  
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful business insights that support decision-making.
