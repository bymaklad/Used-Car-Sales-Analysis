Used Car Sales – Power BI Analysis Project
Project Overview

This project delivers a complete analytical study of a used car sales dataset using Power BI.
The workflow includes data cleaning, normalization, modelling, DAX calculations, and building interactive dashboards that reveal key business insights.

The objective is to transform raw unstructured data into a meaningful analytical model that supports decision-making across manufacturers, engine sizes, fuel types, pricing patterns, and year-based availability trends.

Dataset & Scope

The dataset includes more than 50,000 used cars with attributes such as:

Manufacturer

Model

Engine size

Fuel type

Year of manufacture

Price

The analysis focuses on identifying:

Market trends

High-demand models

Price patterns by engine size and fuel type

Year-based supply availability

Manufacturer-level performance

Dashboard Highlights
Key Insights extracted from the dashboard include:

Toyota and Ford lead in total car count and total sales amount.

Engine sizes 1.4, 1.8, and 2.0 represent the highest availability in the market.

Hybrid engines show the highest average price, followed by petrol and diesel.

Cars manufactured in 2018, 2017, 2016, 2019, and 2015 represent the peak availability years.

Certain models (such as Golf, Polo, Fiesta, RAV4) dominate their categories in volume.
